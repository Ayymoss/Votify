# Votify - Plugin for RaidMax's IW4MAdmin

Votify allows you to start or add to a vote on your server. Vote on map change, map skip, kicking a player or banning a player.

***

## Commands:
```
!votemap (!vm) <map>
!voteskip (!vs)
!votekick (!vk) <target> <reason>
!voteban (!vb) <target> <reason>
!yes (!y)
!no (!n)

!cancelvote (!cv) - Cancels on-going vote (Moderator)
```

Note, the configuration will create/update on load. Changes made to the configuration will need IW4MAdmin restarted.

Configuration is in `Configuration/VotifySettings.json`
